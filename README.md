Clientside Encryption and Decryption of Content (CEDC) allows a user to confidently post potentially speculative content to social media sites, give keys to friends, and know that only they can view this content. There is seemless decryption of pictures and text which does not ruin the user experience for those with the keys. Those without the keys will only see gibberish, and since it's clientside in the plugin you know your keys are safe. Just be careful how you distribute the keys.

To generate and manage your keys right click on the icon and select "Options".

I do not use Chrome Sync, as that would send your data to Google's servers where they "encrypt" it for you ... which really means they have your keys. In lieu of that, i'm using storage.local to keep them on your machine only. There is an Export and Import button in the extension to allow you to manage your keys easily. Remember that uninstalling this extension will delete your keys forever, so before doing so you should export them for re-import later.
