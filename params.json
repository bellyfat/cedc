{"google":"","name":"Cedc","body":"### What it is\r\nCEDC allows anyone to encrypt content, post it to a social media site, and ensure the message can only be seen by those that you allow to see it.  This means sites such as Facebook can't read your message, tag your face in pictures, or keep any of your content when you choose to delete it (since they can't even read it).\r\n\r\n### How does it work\r\nCEDC works by utilizing the AES cipher.  On the client side (your browser) you enter some text (or drag/drop a picture) into the plugin.  After selecting the key you want to encrypt it with you can then safely post it on any social media outlet you want.  The text or picture is now an obfuscated wall of text that only those you give your key to (stored on client side) will be able to see it seamlessly.\r\n\r\nSending your key to someone whom saves it in the \"decrypt\" section of their plugin can then visit any page and automatically decrypt any found encrypted content.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nInstall the chrome plugin.  In the Wrench -> Tools -> Extensions page go to the \"Options\" of the CEDC plugin.  You can enter a key (like \"r1e2t4\") or generate a random key (256 characters).  Avoid keys like \"dodgers123\".  Save the key with a label.  The label is only used for yourself so you don't get confused about who should have what key.\r\n\r\nNow with an encryption key, go ahead and give it to your friends/family/coworkers.  An example is a 3 key system, where you have a \"friends\", \"coworkers\", and \"family\" key set up to restrict who can see what.  If you're a dissident of government be aware that any commercial product can be read by the government and should be avoided when communicating private keys to people.\r\n\r\nSelecting the plugin's icon in the toolbar loads a page where you can encrypt text or pictures.  This is the stuff you post online.\r\n\r\nBe sure to add keys friends give you in the \"decrypt\" section to seamlessly view content they post.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nAsk a question in the wiki, submit a bug, email me!\r\n","tagline":"Client side encryption and decryption of images and text on any website","note":"Don't delete this file!
